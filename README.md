# VisionX: Advanced Image Processing and Edge Detection Tool

VisionX is a sophisticated desktop application crafted in C++ utilizing the Qt framework. It offers a variety of options for manipulating images,with an easy to use interface, including noise addition, filtering, edge detection, histogram analysis, image equalization and normalization, thresholding, frequency domain filters, and the creation of hybrid images.

## Features

1. **Noise Addition**
   - Uniform, Gaussian, and Salt and Pepper Noise

2. **Filtering**
   - Low Pass Filters
   - Average, Gaussian, and Median Filters

3. **Edge Detection**
   - Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny Edge Detection

4. **Histogram Analysis**
   - Generation and Visualization of Histograms
   - Plotting of Distribution Curves

5. **Image Equalization**

6. **Image Normalization**

7. **Thresholding**
   - Local and Global Thresholding Techniques

8. **Color Image Transformation**
   - Conversion to Grayscale
   - Plotting of RGB Histograms with Distribution Functions

9. **Frequency Domain Filters**
   - Highpass and Lowpass Filters

10. **Hybrid Image Creation**
    - Blending of Images to Create Hybrid Effects

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Ensure Qt is installed on your system.
2. Clone the VisionX repository to your local machine.

### Building

1. Open the project in Qt Creator.
2. Build the project to generate the executable.
